	abstract = {While there is a long history of investigating sociophonetic
variation in speech, it has been less studied in computer mediated
communication contexts such as Twitter. The most obvious reason
for this is that interactions in Twitter are text-based and therefore
do not include acoustic information. Twitter users are, however,
encoding sociophonetic information through their use of variant
spellings, such as {\textquotedblleft}awn{\textquotedblright} for {\textquotedblleft}on{\textquotedblright}. This study provides evidence
that Twitter users in multiple dialect regions are using variant
spellings to encode sociophonetic variation in a systematic way
and that these variant spelling are sensitive to style shifting. The
methodology used here may be used in future studies to determine
the salience of sociophonetic variables.

	journal = {Northwest Linguistic Conference},
	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Background: Variation in speech and variant spellings in writing (e.g. {\textquotedblleft}becawse{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}go awn{\textquotedblright}) play similar social roles (Sebba 2003, Paolillo 2001). This study extends that parallel by showing that variant spellings are used a systematic way that mirrors variation in speech. Methodology: Tweets were selected that showed a distinction between /ɑ/and /ɔ/{\textendash} which is found in African American English and the Southern American English (Labov, Ash \& Boburg 2005). The Twitter public API was used to extract recent tweets that used an {\textquotedblleft}aw{\textquotedblright} spelling of one of the six most frequent /ɔ/ words in English. The tweets were then hand-sorted to remove tweets where the target word occurred as an acronym, name, non-English term, typo or URL. The resulting 74 tweets were hand-coded for the number and type of variant spellings found. Results: Half of the tweets (37/74) included more than one variant spelling. The most commonly encoded variables were th-stopping (19 instances), g-dropping (12 instances), r-lessness (10 instances), cluster reduction (8 instances), and /ai/ monophthongization (4 instances). An example is shown in (1).

This suggests that Twitter users who use variant spellings do so in a systematic way that reflects patterns observed in speech.},

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Purpose: The present study was designed to evaluate use of spectral and temporal cues, under conditions where both types of cues were available. Method: Participants included adults with normal hearing and hearing loss. We focused on three categories of speech cues: static spectral (spectral shape); dynamic spectral (formant change); and temporal (amplitude envelope). Spectral and/or temporal dimensions of synthetic speech were systematically manipulated along a continuum and recognition was measured using the manipulated stimuli. Level was controlled to ensure cue audibility. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine to what degree spectral and temporal information contributed to the identification of each stimulus. Results: Listeners with normal hearing were influenced to a greater extent by spectral cues for all stimuli. Listeners with hearing impairment generally utilized spectral cues when the information was static (spectral shape) and but used temporal cues when the information was dynamic (formant transition). The relative use of spectral and temporal dimensions varied among individuals, especially among listeners with hearing loss. Conclusions: Information about spectral and temporal cue use may aid in identifying listeners who rely to a greater extent on particular acoustic cues, and to apply that information toward therapeutic interventions.},
